# Arduino-Swamp-Cooler
A fully developed swamp cooler designed, manufactured, and programmed by Justin Carlson.

The parts required for this project were:

2 square feet of Stainless Steel
1 5v water pump
2 5-9v Axial Fans
1 Arduino MEGA256
1 Arduino Compatible Water-Level Sensor
1 Arduino Comaptible 16x2 LCD display
1 5K ohm potentiometer
1 Arduino Comaptible 3x1 Humidity Sensor
1 Arduino 5v/3v Power Supply
1 square foot of evaporative cooler filter
1 foot of vinyl tubing
1 Empty and Cleaned, one gallon milk container
and Some unidentifiable amount of hot glue


The schematic for the chasis is as shown and was cut from stainless steel and bent into shape:

After the chasis was built, a test fitting of parts to ensure:
